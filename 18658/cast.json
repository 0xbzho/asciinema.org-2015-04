The command is designed to work without user interaction.\r\n\r\n       curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy support, user authentication, FTP upload, HTTP post,  SSL  connections,  cookies,  file  transfer\r\n       resume, Metalink, and more. As you will see below, the number of features will make your head spin!\r\n\r\n       curl is powered by libcurl for all transfer-related features. See libcurl(3) for details.\r\n\r\nURL\r\n       The URL syntax is protocol-dependent. You'll find a detailed description in RFC 3986.\r\n\r\n       You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs by writing part sets within braces as in:\r\n\r\n        http://site.{one,two,three}.com\r\n\r\n       or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:\r\n\r\n        ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[1-100].txt\r\n        ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[001-100].txt    (with leading zeros)\r\n        ftp://ftp.letters.com/file[a-z].txt\r\n\r\n       Nested sequences are not supported, but you can use several ones next to each other:\r\n\r\n        http://any.org/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html\r\n\r\n       You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line. They will be fetched in a sequential manner in the specified order.\r\n\r\n       You can specify a step counter for the ranges to get every Nth number or letter:\r\n\r\n        http://www.numericals.com/file[1-100:10].txt\r\n        http://www.letters.com/file[a-z:2].txt\r\n\r\n       If  you specify URL without protocol:// prefix, curl will attempt to guess what protocol you might want. It will then default to HTTP but try other\r\n       protocols based on often-used host name prefixes. For example, for host names starting with \"ftp.\" curl will assume you want to speak FTP.\r\n\r\n       curl will do its best to use what you pass to it as a URL. It is not trying to validate it as a syntactically correct  URL  by  any  means  but  is\r\n       instead very liberal with what it accepts.\r\n\r\n       curl  will attempt to re-use connections for multiple file transfers, so that getting many files from the same server will not do multiple connects\r\n       / handshakes. This improves speed. Of course this is only done on files specified on a single command line and cannot be used between separate curl\r\n       invokes.\r\n\r\nPROGRESS METER\r\n       curl normally displays a progress meter during operations, indicating the amount of transferred data, transfer speeds and estimated time left, etc.\r\n\r\n       curl displays this data to the terminal by default, so if you invoke curl to do an operation and it is about to write data to the terminal, it dis-\r\n       ables the progress meter as otherwise it would mess up the output mixing progress meter and response data.\r\n\r\n       If you want a progress meter for HTTP POST or PUT requests, you need to redirect the response output to a file, using shell redirect (\u003e), -o [file]\r\n       or similar.\r\n\r\n       It is not the same case for FTP upload as that operation does not spit out any response data to the terminal.\r\n\r\n       If you prefer a progress \"bar\" instead of the regular meter, -# is your friend.\r\n\r\nOPTIONS\r\n       Options start with one or two dashes. Many of the options require an addition value next to it.\r\n\r\n       The  short  \"single-dash\"  form of the options, -d for example, may be used with or without a space between it and its value, although a space is a\r\n       recommended separator. The long \"double-dash\" form, --data for example, requires a space between it and its value.\r\n\r\n       Short version options that don't need any additional values can be used immediately next to each"

That is, you use the exact same option name but\r\n       prefix it with \"no-\". However, in this list we mostly only list and show the --option version of them. (This concept with --no options was added in\r\n       7.19.0. Previously most options were toggled on/off on repeated use of the same command line option.)\r\n\r\n       -#, --progress-bar\r\n              Make curl display progress as a simple progress bar instead of the standard, more informational, meter.\r\n\r\n       -0, --http1.0\r\n              (HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP version 1.0 instead of using its internally preferred: HTTP 1.1.\r\n\r\n       --http1.1\r\n              (HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP version 1.1. This is the internal default version. (Added in 7.33.0)\r\n\r\n       --http2.0\r\n              (HTTP) Tells curl to issue its requests using HTTP 2.0. This requires that the underlying libcurl was built to support it. (Added in 7.33.0)\r\n\r\n       -1, --tlsv1\r\n              (SSL) Forces curl to use TLS version 1 when negotiating with a remote TLS server.\r\n\r\n       -2, --sslv2\r\n              (SSL) Forces curl to use SSL version 2 when negotiating with a remote SSL server.\r\n\r\n       -3, --sslv3\r\n              (SSL) Forces curl to use SSL version 3 when negotiating with a remote SSL server.\r\n\r\n       -4, --ipv4\r\n              If  curl  is  capable of resolving an address to multiple IP versions (which it is if it is IPv6-capable), this option tells curl to resolve\r\n              names to IPv4 addresses only.\r\n\r\n       -6, --ipv6\r\n              If curl is capable of resolving an address to multiple IP versions (which it is if it is IPv6-capable), this option tells  curl  to  resolve\r\n              names to IPv6 addresses only.\r\n\r\n       -a, --append\r\n              (FTP/SFTP) When used in an upload, this will tell curl to append to the target file instead of overwriting it. If the file doesn't exist, it\r\n              will be created.  Note that this flag is ignored by some SSH servers (including OpenSSH).\r\n\r\n       -A, --user-agent \u003cagent string\u003e\r\n              (HTTP) Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server. Some badly done CGIs fail if this field  isn't  set  to  \"Mozilla/4.0\".  To\r\n              encode blanks in the string, surround the string with single quote marks. This can also be set with the -H, --header option of course.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n       --anyauth\r\n              (HTTP) Tells curl to figure out authentication method by itself, and use the most secure one the remote site claims to support. This is done\r\n              by first doing a request and checking the response-headers, thus possibly inducing an extra network round-trip. This is used instead of set-\r\n              ting a specific authentication method, which you can do with --basic, --digest, --ntlm, and --negotiate.\r\n\r\n              Note  that  using  --anyauth is not recommended if you do uploads from stdin, since it may require data to be sent twice and then the client\r\n              must be able to rewind. If the need should arise when uploading from stdin, the upload operation will fail.\r\n\r\n       -b, --cookie \u003cname=data\u003e\r\n              (HTTP) Pass the data to the HTTP server as a cookie. It is supposedly the data previously received from the server in a \"Set-Cookie:\"  line.\r\n              The data should be in the format \"NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2\".\r\n\r\n              If  no  '=' symbol is used in the line, it is treated as a filename to use to read previously stored cookie lines from, which should be used\r\n              in this session if they match. Using this method also activates the \"cookie parser\" which will make curl record incoming cookies too,  which\r\n              may  be handy if you're using this in combination with the -L, --location option.

This is the default and this option is usually pointless, unless you use it to  override\r\n              a previously set option that sets a different authentication method (such as --ntlm, --digest, or --negotiate).\r\n\r\n       -c, --cookie-jar \u003cfile name\u003e\r\n              (HTTP)  Specify to which file you want curl to write all cookies after a completed operation. Curl writes all cookies previously read from a\r\n              specified file as well as all cookies received from remote server(s). If no cookies are known, no file will be written.  The  file  will  be\r\n              written using the Netscape cookie file format. If you set the file name to a single dash, \"-\", the cookies will be written to stdout.\r\n\r\n              This  command  line  option will activate the cookie engine that makes curl record and use cookies. Another way to activate it is to use the\r\n              -b, --cookie option.\r\n\r\n              If the cookie jar can't be created or written to, the whole curl operation won't fail or even report an error clearly. Using -v will  get  a\r\n              warning displayed, but that is the only visible feedback you get about this possibly lethal situation.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last specified file name will be used.\r\n\r\n       -C, --continue-at \u003coffset\u003e\r\n              Continue/Resume  a  previous file transfer at the given offset. The given offset is the exact number of bytes that will be skipped, counting\r\n              from the beginning of the source file before it is transferred to the destination.  If used with uploads, the FTP server command  SIZE  will\r\n              not be used by curl.\r\n\r\n              Use \"-C -\" to tell curl to automatically find out where/how to resume the transfer. It then uses the given output/input files to figure that\r\n              out.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n       --ciphers \u003clist of ciphers\u003e\r\n              (SSL) Specifies which ciphers to use in the connection. The list of ciphers must specify valid ciphers. Read up on SSL cipher  list  details\r\n              on this URL: http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html\r\n\r\n              NSS  ciphers  are  done  differently  than  OpenSSL  and  GnuTLS.

This option creates the\r\n              dirs mentioned with the -o option, nothing else. If the -o file name uses no dir or if the dirs it mentions already exist, no  dir  will  be\r\n              created.\r\n\r\n              To create remote directories when using FTP or SFTP, try --ftp-create-dirs.\r\n\r\n       --crlf (FTP) Convert LF to CRLF in upload.

This will cause curl to pass the data to the server using the content-type application/x-www-form-urlen-\r\n              coded.  Compare to -F, --form.\r\n\r\n              -d, --data is the same as --data-ascii. To post data purely binary, you should instead use the --data-binary option. To URL-encode the value\r\n              of a form field you may use --data-urlencode.\r\n\r\n              If any of these options is used more than once on the same command line, the data pieces specified will be merged together with a separating\r\n              \u0026-symbol. Thus, using '-d name=daniel -d skill=lousy' would generate a post chunk that looks like 'name=daniel\u0026skill=lousy'.\r\n\r\n              If you start the data with the letter @, the rest should be a file name to read the data from, or - if you want curl to read the  data  from\r\n              stdin.  Multiple files can also be specified. Posting data from a file named 'foobar' would thus be done with --data @foobar.

The file may contain multiple CA certificates. The certificate(s)\r\n              must be in PEM format. Normally curl is built to use a default file for this, so this option is typically used to alter that default file.\r\n\r\n              curl recognizes the environment variable named 'CURL_CA_BUNDLE' if it is set, and uses the given path as a path to a CA  cert  bundle.  This\r\n              option overrides that variable.\r\n\r\n              The  windows  version  of  curl  will  automatically  look  for  a CA certs file named 'curl-ca-bundle.crt', either in the same directory as\r\n              curl.exe, or in the Current Working Directory, or in any folder along your PATH.\r\n\r\n              If curl is built against the NSS SSL library, the NSS PEM PKCS#11 module (libnsspem.so) needs to be available for this option to work  prop-\r\n              erly.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n       --capath \u003cCA certificate directory\u003e\r\n              (SSL)  Tells  curl to use the specified certificate directory to verify the peer. Multiple paths can be provided by separating them with \":\"\r\n              (e.g.  \"path1:path2:path3\"). The certificates must be in PEM format, and if curl is built against OpenSSL, the directory must have been pro-\r\n              cessed  using  the  c_rehash  utility supplied with OpenSSL. Using --capath can allow OpenSSL-powered curl to make SSL-connections much more\r\n              efficiently than using --cacert if the --cacert file contains many CA certificates.\r\n\r\n              If this option is set, the default capath value will be ignored, and if it is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n       -f, --fail\r\n              (HTTP) Fail silently (no output at all) on server errors. This is mostly done to better enable  scripts  etc  to  better  deal  with  failed\r\n              attempts.  In  normal  cases  when  an  HTTP  server  fails  to deliver a document, it returns an HTML document stating so (which often also\r\n              describes why and more). This flag will prevent curl from outputting that and return error 22.\r\n\r\n              This method is not fail-safe and there are occasions where non-successful response codes will slip through, especially  when  authentication\r\n              is involved (response codes 401 and 407).\r\n\r\n       -F, --form \u003cname=content\u003e\r\n              (HTTP)  This  lets curl emulate a filled-in form in which a user has pressed the submit button. This causes curl to POST data using the Con-\r\n              tent-Type multipart/form-data according to RFC 2388. This enables uploading of binary files etc. To force the 'content' part to be  a  file,\r\n              prefix  the  file  name  with  an  @  sign. To just get the content part from a file, prefix the file name with the symbol \u003c. The difference\r\n              between @ and \u003c is then that @ makes a file get attached in the post as a file upload, while the \u003c makes a text field and just get the  con-\r\n              tents for that text field from a file.\r\n\r\n              Example, to send your password file to the server, where 'password' is the name of the form-field to which /etc/passwd will be the input:\r\n\r\n              curl -F password=@/etc/passwd www.mypasswords.com\r\n\r\n              To read content from stdin instead of a file, use - as the filename. This goes for both @ and \u003c constructs.\r\n\r\n              You can also tell curl what Content-Type to use by using 'type=', in a manner similar to:\r\n\r\n              curl -F \"web=@index.html;type=text/html\" url.com\r\n\r\n              or\r\n\r\n              curl -F \"name=daniel;type=text/foo\" url.com\r\n\r\n              You can also explicitly change the name field of a file upload part by setting filename=, like this:\r\n\r\n              curl -F \"file=@localfile;filename=nameinpost\" url.com\r\n\r\n              If filename/path contains ',' or ';', it must be quoted by double-quote"

This is the default but the slowest behavior.\r\n\r\n              nocwd  curl  does  no  CWD  at all. curl will do SIZE, RETR, STOR etc and give a full path to the server for all these commands.

Use this in preference to --form if there's any possibility that the string value may\r\n              accidentally trigger the '@' or '\u003c' features of --form.\r\n\r\n       -g, --globoff\r\n              This option switches off the \"URL globbing parser\". When you set this option, you can specify URLs that contain  the  letters  {}[]  without\r\n              having them being interpreted by curl itself. Note that these letters are not normal legal URL contents but they should be encoded according\r\n              to the URI standard.\r\n\r\n       -G, --get\r\n              When used, this option will make all data specified with -d, --data, --data-binary or --data-urlencode to be used in  an  HTTP  GET  request\r\n              instead of the POST request that otherwise would be used. The data will be appended to the URL with a '?' separator.\r\n\r\n              If used in combination with -I, the POST data will instead be appended to the URL with a HEAD request.\r\n\r\n              If  this  option  is  used  several times, only the first one is used. This is because undoing a GET doesn't make sense, but you should then\r\n              instead enforce the alternative method you prefer.\r\n\r\n       -H, --header \u003cheader\u003e\r\n              (HTTP) Extra header to use when getting a web page. You may specify any number of extra headers. Note that if you should add a custom header\r\n              that has the same name as one of the internal ones curl would use, your externally set header will be used instead of the internal one. This\r\n              allows you to make even trickier stuff than curl would normally do. You should not replace internally set headers without knowing  perfectly\r\n              well what you're doing. Remove an internal header by giving a replacement without content on the right side of the colon, as in: -H \"Host:\".\r\n              If you send the custom header with no-value then its header must be terminated with a semicolon, such as -H \"X-Custom-Header;\" to  send  \"X-\r\n              Custom-Header:\".\r\n\r\n              curl  will  make sure that each header you add/replace is sent with the proper end-of-line marker, you should thus not add that as a part of\r\n              the header content: do not add newlines or carriage returns, they will only mess things up for you.\r\n\r\n              See also the -A, --user-agent and -e, --referer options.\r\n\r\n              This option can be used multiple times to add/replace/remove multiple headers.\r\n\r\n       --hostpubmd5 \u003cmd5\u003e\r\n              (SCP/SFTP) Pass a string containing 32 hexadecimal digits. The string should be the 128 bit MD5 checksum of the remote  host's  public  key,\r\n              curl will refuse the connection with the host unless the md5sums match. (Added in 7.17.1)\r\n\r\n       --ignore-content-length\r\n              (HTTP)  Ignore  the  Content-Length header. This is particularly useful for servers running Apache 1.x, which will report incorrect Content-\r\n              Length for files larger than 2 gigabytes.\r\n\r\n       -i, --include\r\n              (HTTP) Include the HTTP-header in the output. The HTTP-header includes things like server-name,  "

HTTP-servers feature the command HEAD which this uses to get nothing but the header of a docu-\r\n              ment. When used on an FTP or FILE file, curl displays the file size and last modification time only.\r\n\r\n       --interface \u003cname\u003e\r\n              Perform an operation using a specified interface. You can enter interface name, IP address or host name. An example could look like:\r\n\r\n               curl --interface eth0:1 http://www.netscape.com/\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n       -j, --junk-session-cookies\r\n              (HTTP) When curl is told to read cookies from a given file, this option will make it discard all \"session cookies\". This will basically have\r\n              the same effect as if a new session is started. Typical browsers always discard session cookies when they're closed down.\r\n\r\n       -J, --remote-header-name\r\n              (HTTP) This option tells the -O, --remote-name option to use the server-specified Content-Disposition filename instead of extracting a file-\r\n              name from the URL.\r\n\r\n              There's no attempt to decode %-sequences (yet) in the provided file name, so this option may provide you with rather unexpected file names.\r\n\r\n       -k, --insecure\r\n              (SSL) This option explicitly allows curl to perform \"insecure\" SSL connections and transfers. All SSL connections are attempted to  be  made\r\n              secure  by using the CA certificate bundle installed by default. This makes all connections considered \"insecure\" fail unless -k, --insecure\r\n              is used.\r\n\r\n              See this online resource for further details: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html\r\n\r\n       -K, --config \u003cconfig file\u003e\r\n              Specify which config file to read curl arguments from. The config file is a text file in which command line arguments can be  written  which\r\n              then will be used as if they were written on the actual command line.\r\n\r\n              Options and their parameters must be specified on the same config file line, separated by whitespace, colon, or the equals sign. Long option\r\n              names can optionally be given in the config file without the initial double dashes and if so, the colon or equals characters can be used  as\r\n              separators.  If the option is specified with one or two dashes, there can be no colon or equals character between the option and its parame-\r\n              ter.\r\n\r\n              If the parameter is to contain whitespace, the parameter must be  enclosed  within  quotes.  Within  double  quotes,  the  following  escape\r\n              sequences  are available: \\\\, \\\", \\t, \\n, \\r and \\v. A backslash preceding any other letter is ignored. If the first column of a config line\r\n              is a '#' character, the rest of the line will be treated as a comment. Only write one option per physical line in the config file.\r\n\r\n              Specify the filename to -K, --config as '-' to make curl read the file from stdin.\r\n\r\n              Note that to be able to specify a URL in the config file, you need to specify it using the --url option, and not by simply writing  the  URL\r\n              on its own line. So, it could look similar to this:\r\n\r\n              url = \"http://curl.haxx.se/docs/\"\r\n\r\n              When  curl  is  invoked,  it  always  (unless  -q is used) checks for a default config file and uses it if found. The default config file is\r\n              checked for in the following places in this order:\r\n\r\n              1) curl tries to find the \"home dir\": It first checks for the CURL_HOME and then the HOME environment variables. Failing that, it uses getp-\r\n              wuid()  on  UNIX-like systems (which returns the home dir given the current user in your system). On Windows, it then checks for the APPDATA\r\n              variable, or as a last resort the '%USERPROFILE%\\Application Data'.\r\n\r\n      "

    [

      "        2) On windows, if there is no _curlrc file in the home dir, it checks for one in the same dir the curl executable is  placed.  On  UNIX-like\r\n              systems, it will simply try to load .curlrc from the determined home dir.\r\n\r\n              # --- Example file ---\r\n              # this is a comment\r\n              url = \"curl.haxx.se\"\r\n              output = \"curlhere.html\"\r\n              user-agent = \"superagent/1.0\"\r\n\r\n              # and fetch another URL too\r\n              url = \"curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html\"\r\n              -O\r\n              referer = \"http://nowhereatall.com/\"\r\n              # --- End of example file ---\r\n\r\n              This option can be used multiple times to load multiple config files.\r\n\r\n       --keepalive-time \u003cseconds\u003e\r\n              This  option  sets  the  time  a  connection  needs to remain idle before sending keepalive probes and the time between individual keepalive\r\n              probes. It is currently effective on operating systems offering the TCP_KEEPIDLE and TCP_KEEPINTVL socket  options  (meaning  Linux,  recent\r\n              AIX, HP-UX and more). This option has no effect if --no-keepalive is used. (Added in 7.18.0)\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. If unspecified, the option defaults to 60 seconds.\r\n\r\n       --key \u003ckey\u003e\r\n              (SSL/SSH) Private key file name. Allows you to provide your private key in this separate file.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n       --key-type \u003ctype\u003e\r\n              (SSL)  Private  key file type. Specify which type your --key provided private key is. DER, PEM, and ENG are supported. If not specified, PEM\r\n              is assumed.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n       --krb \u003clevel\u003e\r\n              (FTP) Enable Kerberos authentication and use. The level must be entered and should be one of 'clear', 'safe', 'confidential', or  'private'.\r\n              Should you use a level that is not one of these, 'private' will instead be used.\r\n\r\n              This  option requires a library built with kerberos4 or GSSAPI (GSS-Negotiate) support. This is not very common. Use -V, --version to see if\r\n              your curl supports it.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n       -l, --list-only\r\n              (FTP) When listing an FTP directory, this switch forces a name-only view. This is especially useful if the user wants to  machine-parse  the\r\n              contents of an FTP directory since the normal directory view doesn't use a standard look or format. When used like this, the option causes a\r\n              NLST command to be sent to the server instead of LIST.\r\n\r\n              Note: Some FTP servers list only files in their response to NLST; they do not include sub-directories and symbolic links.\r\n\r\n              (POP3) When retrieving a specific email from POP3, this switch forces a LIST command to be performed instead of RETR. This  is  particularly\r\n              useful if the user wants to see if a specific message id exists on the server and what size it is.\r\n\r\n              Note:  When  combined with -X, --request \u003ccommand\u003e, this option can be used to send an UIDL command instead, so the user may use the email's\r\n              unique identifier rather than it's message id to make the request. (Added in 7.21.5)\r\n\r\n       -L, --location\r\n              (HTTP/HTTPS) If the server reports that the requested page has moved to a different location (indicated with a Location: header  and  a  3XX\r\n              response  code),  this  option  will make curl redo the request on the new place. If used together with -i, --include or -I, --head, headers\r\n              from all requested pages will be shown. When authentication is used, curl only sends its credentials to the  initial  host.  If  a  redirect\r\n              takes  curl to a different host, it won't be able to intercept the user+password.

You can\r\n              limit the amount of redirects to follow by using the --max-redirs option.\r\n\r\n              When curl follows a redirect and the request is not a plain GET (for example POST or PUT), it will do the following request with  a  GET  if\r\n              the  HTTP response was 301, 302, or 303.

Appending 'k' or 'K' will count the number as kilobytes,  'm'  or\r\n              M' makes it megabytes, while 'g' or 'G' makes it gigabytes. Examples: 200K, 3m and 1G.\r\n\r\n              The given rate is the average speed counted during the entire transfer. It means that curl might use higher transfer speeds in short bursts,\r\n              but over time it uses no more than the given rate.\r\n\r\n              If you also use the -Y, --speed-limit option, that option will take precedence and might cripple the rate-limiting slightly, to help keeping\r\n              the speed-limit logic working.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n       --local-port \u003cnum\u003e[-num]\r\n              Set  a preferred number or range of local port numbers to use for the connection(s).

      "specified.\r\n\r\n\r\n       --netrc-optional\r\n              Very similar to --netrc, but this option makes the .netrc usage optional and not mandatory as the --netrc option does.\r\n\r\n\r\n       --negotiate\r\n              (HTTP) Enables GSS-Negotiate authentication. The GSS-Negotiate method was designed by Microsoft and is used in their web applications. It is\r\n              primarily meant as a support for Kerberos5 authentication but may be also used along with another authentication method. For  more  informa-\r\n              tion see IETF draft draft-brezak-spnego-http-04.txt.\r\n\r\n              If you want to enable Negotiate for your proxy authentication, then use --proxy-negotiate.\r\n\r\n              This  option  requires  a library built with GSSAPI support. This is not very common. Use -V, --version to see if your version supports GSS-\r\n              Negotiate.\r\n\r\n              When using this option, you must also provide a fake -u, --user option to activate the authentication code properly. Sending  a  '-u  :'  is\r\n              enough as the user name and password from the -u option aren't actually used.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, only the first one is used.\r\n\r\n       --no-keepalive\r\n              Disables the use of keepalive messages on the TCP connection, as by default curl enables them.\r\n\r\n              Note that this is the negated option name documented. You can thus use --keepalive to enforce keepalive.\r\n\r\n       --no-sessionid\r\n              (SSL)  Disable curl's use of SSL session-ID caching.  By default all transfers are done using the cache. Note that while nothing should ever\r\n              get hurt by attempting to reuse SSL session-IDs, there seem to be broken SSL implementations in the wild that may  require  you  to  disable\r\n              this in order for you to succeed. (Added in 7.16.0)\r\n\r\n              Note that this is the negated option name documented. You can thus use --sessionid to enforce session-ID caching.\r\n\r\n       --noproxy \u003cno-proxy-list\u003e\r\n              Comma-separated  list  of hosts which do not use a proxy, if one is specified.  The only wildcard is a single * character, which matches all\r\n              hosts, and effectively disables the proxy. Each name in this list is matched as either a domain which contains the hostname, or the hostname\r\n              itself. For example, local.com would match local.com, local.com:80, and www.local.com, but not www.notlocal.com.  (Added in 7.19.4).\r\n\r\n       --ntlm (HTTP) Enables NTLM authentication. The NTLM authentication method was designed by Microsoft and is used by IIS web servers. It is a propri-\r\n              etary protocol, reverse-engineered by clever people and implemented in curl based on their efforts. This kind  of  behavior  should  not  be\r\n              endorsed, you should encourage everyone who uses NTLM to switch to a public and documented authentication method instead, such as Digest.\r\n\r\n              If you want to enable NTLM for your proxy authentication, then use --proxy-ntlm.\r\n\r\n              This option requires a library built with SSL support. Use -V, --version to see if your curl supports NTLM.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, only the first one is used.\r\n\r\n       -o, --output \u003cfile\u003e\r\n              Write output to \u003cfile\u003e instead of stdout. If you are using {} or [] to fetch multiple documents, you can use '#' followed by a number in the\r\n              \u003cfile\u003e specifier. That variable will be replaced with the current string for the URL being fetched. Like in:\r\n\r\n                curl http://{one,two}.site.com -o \"file_#1.txt\"\r\n\r\n              or use several variables like:\r\n\r\n                curl http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com -o \"#1_#2\"\r\n\r\n              You may use this option as many times as the number of URLs you have.\r\n\r\n              See also the --create-dirs option to create the local directories dynamically. Specifying the output as '-' (a single dash) will  force  the\r\n              output to be done to stdout.\r\n\r\n       -O, --remote-name\r\n              Write"

The tunnel approach is made with the HTTP proxy CONNECT request and  requires  that  the  proxy  allows\r\n              direct connect to the remote port number curl wants to tunnel through to.\r\n\r\n       -P, --ftp-port \u003caddress\u003e\r\n              (FTP) Reverses the default initiator/listener roles when connecting with FTP. This switch makes curl use active mode. In practice, curl then\r\n              tells the server to connect back to the client's specified address and port, while passive mode asks the server to setup an IP  address  and\r\n              port for it to connect to. \u003caddress\u003e should be one of:\r\n\r\n              interface\r\n                     i.e \"eth0\" to specify which interface's IP address you want to use (Unix only)\r\n\r\n              IP address\r\n                     i.e \"192.168.10.1\" to specify the exact IP address\r\n\r\n              host name\r\n                     i.e \"my.host.domain\" to specify the machine\r\n\r\n              -      make curl pick the same IP address that is already used for the control connection\r\n\r\n       If  this option is used several times, the last one will be used. Disable the use of PORT with --ftp-pasv. Disable the attempt to use the EPRT com-\r\n       mand instead of PORT by using --disable-eprt. EPRT is really PORT++.\r\n\r\n       Starting in 7.19.5, you can append \":[start]-[end]\" to the right of the address, to tell curl what TCP port range to use. That means you specify  a\r\n       port  range,  from  a lower to a higher number. A single number works as well, but do note that it increases the risk of failure since the port may\r\n       not be available.\r\n\r\n       --pass \u003cphrase\u003e\r\n              (SSL/SSH) Passphrase for the private key\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n       --post301\r\n              (HTTP) Tells curl to respect RFC 2616/10.3.2 and not convert POST requests into GET requests when following a 301 redirection.

      " (FTP/SFTP)  Send  an arbitrary command to the remote FTP or SFTP server. Quote commands are sent BEFORE the transfer takes place (just after\r\n              the initial PWD command in an FTP transfer, to be exact). To make commands take place after a successful transfer, prefix them with  a  dash\r\n              '-'.   To make commands be sent after curl has changed the working directory, just before the transfer command(s), prefix the command with a\r\n              '+' (this is only supported for FTP). You may specify any number of commands. If the server returns failure for one  of  the  commands,  the\r\n              entire operation will be aborted. You must send syntactically correct FTP commands as RFC 959 defines to FTP servers, or one of the commands\r\n              listed below to SFTP servers.  This option can be used multiple times. When speaking to an FTP server, prefix the command with  an  asterisk\r\n              (*) to make curl continue even if the command fails as by default curl will stop at first failure.\r\n\r\n              SFTP  is a binary protocol. Unlike for FTP, curl interprets SFTP quote commands itself before sending them to the server.  File names may be\r\n              quoted shell-style to embed spaces or special characters.  Following is the list of all supported SFTP quote commands:\r\n\r\n              chgrp group file\r\n                     The chgrp command sets the group ID of the file named by the file operand to the group ID specified by the group operand.  The  group\r\n                     operand is a decimal integer group ID.\r\n\r\n              chmod mode file\r\n                     The chmod command modifies the file mode bits of the specified file. The mode operand is an octal integer mode number.\r\n\r\n              chown user file\r\n                     The chown command sets the owner of the file named by the file operand to the user ID specified by the user operand.

This includes time_pre-\r\n                             transfer and also the time the server needed to calculate the result.\r\n\r\n              time_total     The total time, in seconds, that the full operation lasted. The time will be displayed with millisecond resolution.\r\n\r\n              url_effective  The URL that was fetched last. This is most meaningful if you've told curl to follow location: headers.\r\n\r\n       If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n       -x, --proxy \u003c[protocol://][user:password@]proxyhost[:port]\u003e\r\n              Use the specified proxy.\r\n\r\n              The proxy string can be specified with a protocol:// prefix to specify alternative proxy protocols. Use socks4://, socks4a://, socks5://  or\r\n              socks5h://  to request the specific SOCKS version to be used. No protocol specified, http:// and all others will be treated as HTTP proxies.\r\n              (The protocol support was added in curl 7.21.7)\r\n\r\n              If the port number is not specified in the proxy string, it is assumed to be 1080.\r\n\r\n              This option overrides existing environment variables that set the proxy to use. If there's an environment variable setting a proxy, you  can\r\n              set proxy to \"\" to override it.\r\n\r\n              All operations that are performed over an HTTP proxy will transparently be converted to HTTP. It means that certain protocol specific opera-\r\n              tions might not be available. This is not the case if you can tunnel through the proxy, as one with the -p, --proxytunnel option.\r\n\r\n              User and password that might be provided in the proxy string are URL decoded by curl. This allows you to pass in special characters such  as\r\n              @ by using %40 or pass in a colon with %3a.\r\n\r\n              The  proxy  host  can  be  specified  the exact same way as the proxy environment variables, including the protocol prefix (http://) and the\r\n              embedded user + password.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n       -X, --request \u003ccommand\u003e\r\n              (HTTP) Specifies a custom request method to use when communicating with the HTTP server.  The specified request will be used instead of  the\r\n              method otherwise used (which defaults to GET). Read the HTTP 1.1 specification for details and explanations. Common additional HTTP requests\r\n              include PUT and DELETE, but related technologies like WebDAV offers PROPFIND, COPY, MOVE and more.\r\n\r\n              Normally you don't need this option. All sorts of GET, HEAD, POST and PUT requests are  rather  invoked  by  using  dedicated  command  line\r\n              options.\r\n\r\n              This  option  only  changes  the actual word used in the HTTP request, it does not alter the way curl behaves. So for example if you want to\r\n              make a proper HEAD request, using -X HEAD will not suffice. You need to use the -I, --head option.\r\n\r\n       "
