Thus, if you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in\r\nyour in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version\r\nthat lacks those changes -- as long as the trunk's `readme.txt` points to the correct stable tag.\r\n\r\n    If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify \"trunk\" if tha"
